#                       Work-Day-Scheduler

##                           Purpose
The objective was to create a Work Day Scheduler that with the help of JQuery and Bootstrap was editable, saved content to localStorage, and whos added events would persist after page refresh. The scheduler was required to contain a save button and color coded rows to show the user which time slot has passsed, which is in the present, and which is a future. I have included a link to view my scheduler in action.  Thank you.
